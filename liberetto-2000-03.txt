== COMMENT ---...-.-...-.--...-.--...-.-...-.....---..-....--.--..-.-.---.--

   This month we moved offices from Antwerp to Brussels, a small step on
   the map, but a big step for iMatix.  First rule of moving: anything you
   did not unpack since the last removal you can now throw out.  Second
   rule of moving: that truck is still *too small*.  Third rule of moving:
   when you stack more than nine banana crates, they fall over.

   For those of you who send us real-Mail, our new address is: 13/15 rue
   des Ateliers, 1080 Brussels, Belgium.  Phone: 02.414.8404.

   This month saw the start of the end of Iridium, the cellphone brick from
   outer space.  I predicted this last year in an (unpublished) Segfault
   article, but then the title of the article was "Microsoft buys Iridium,
   launches MS-SatTV".  Maybe not.

   Iridium was killed by the success of cheap land networks that are slowly
   covering the globe.  These cheap land networks are fuelled by the opening
   of the telecoms market, competition, and technology.  This in turn is
   being given a big push by the Ultimate Killer Application, the Internet.

   Maybe this 'Internet' thing is going to work, after all.  It certainly
   looks like we're heading rapidly towards a future where fast, cheap
   networking is all around us, embedded in our telephones and gadgets,
   changing the way we work, play, and consume.  My friend Jonathan, who
   is our company's social consciousness, might remind me that for the
   majority of people on Earth, the first priority is clean water and
   food, not a mobile phone.  Indeed.  But mobile phones come a close
   third.

   The failure of Iridium marks, for me, the failure of the global
   approach.  No single company can create a global network that can
   compete with a hundred co-operating local networks.  I like this.

== HUMOUR -..-..---...-..-.---...-.---...-..-..---...-.-.-.---...---...-.--

   Sorry, we seem to have turned Liberetto into a serious journal.  This
   is the twenty-somethingth century!  Besides, the next issue of
   Liberetto is due out in a week or so, which makes the editor-in-chief
   really grumpy, so the entire 'jokes' section of Liberetto which
   was originally several pages long has been edited to the following
   phrase:

       "...which might hurt, but not as much as a falling stack of
       banana crates".

   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Hi Pieter,
   I had occasion to revisit the iMatix site today and went to your
   'white papers' section.
   I want to congratulate you (and your team) with the outstanding job you
   have done with GSL (and related stuff).
   Truly impressive. Code generation lives!
   Leif Svalgaard


   Thanks!  (Small historical note: Leif Svalgaard invented modern code
   generation, sometime in 1985.)  We're very happy with GSLgen.  It's a
   wonderful tool in the hands of a skilled programmer.  Our iAF (iMatix
   Application Framework), which the white papers describe, is a GSL
   toolkit that produces entire web applications.  It's a work in
   progress, but already doing wonders.  One example project consists of
   4,500 lines of original code (in the form of XML definition files).
   Using this, iAF produces about 91,000 lines of working source code.
   iAF itself consists of about 14,000 lines of GSL code.  A 20-to-1
   factor is exceptional, and is possible only because GSLgen lets us
   manipulate metadata on an industrial scale.

   If this all sounds like voodoo, that's because it probably is.

   Subject:        	GSLgen and XML standards
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   Do you have any thoughts about the future of GSLgen's schema now that
   the various XML-Schema proposals are nearer to becoming international
   standards? It seems like the basic approach of your tool could be done
   using XML and whatever XSL schema wins. And it looks to me like there
   will be a lot of effort (industry and open source) expended creating
   tools to these standards. 
   Should I worry that GSL will wither on the vine? Do you have any plans
   to move towards standards-conforming schemas? How is GSL superior to the
   proposed standards? Is this issue on your radar?  
   Any feedback is welcome. I like the approach you are using very much.
   Thanks!
   Mark Delaney


   How is GSL superior to XSL?  XSL (XML stylesheets), and XSLT (the XSL
   transform language) offer some of the same basic techniques as GSL.
   But the comparison quickly fades.  As far as I can see, XSL is designed
   to let companies like Microsoft build totally non-standard browsers
   while 'sticking to industry standards'.  XSL schemas define rules for
   showing XML data to the user.

   GSL on the other hand, is a brute-force XML manipulation language,
   designed to churn through masses of XML, extract and calculate, and
   then produce source code, reports, HTML, whatever.  It's a server-side
   approach: for instance, by embedding GSLgen in Xitami, we give
   stylesheet-like capabilities to a web site, irrespective of the browser
   people use.

   GSL diverges from the industry-standard approach in two big ways:
   firstly, it's not itself an XML language.  This is actually a big
   advantage: GSL scripts are easier to read, easier to write, and look
   like normal programs.  Secondly, we do not use DTDs.  We were just
   being lazy, but it turned-out to be well worthwhile.  Since we don't
   use DTDs, you can churn-out GSL scripts quickly and easily.

   GSLgen is also portable, free, fast, etc. etc.  In our experience, the
   more people have gotten into using XSL to do real work, the more they
   start smiling when we explain what GSL is and how it works.

   Look at a reasonably complex GSL application like our iAF framework (see
   the white papers section on imatix.com), and it's hard to see how this
   could work using any of the existing or proposed XSL tools.

   It's my conviction that the industry standard approaches embodied in
   XSL are overweight and corrupted by partisan influence, especially that
   of Microsoft.  This is a shame, because XML brings real and tangible
   benefits, and yet the bulk of industry efforts to exploit it appear to
   be inefficient, if not misdirected.

   My guess is that we'll start to see hybrid approaches that use some XSL
   techniques mixed with scripting languages (maybe JavaScript or Perl),
   at which stage we start to see something like GSLgen emerge.
